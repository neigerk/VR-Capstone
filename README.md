Capstone Project:  VR Rhythm Game
I create 4 function which are Waypoints, Move, Create and ObjDestroy（those file in the asset file）
Waypoint function can set the gameObject movement opint.
Move function afe control the gameObjace movement'speed and time
when user use mouse right botton, the Create function will create same Game object which I have set. 
(when the Create can follow the music beats, I guess we are mostly succesful)
ObjDestroy function is uesd to player dont hit Gameobject, the object will destroy by self.

for the sence I just Creat two GameObject, the DemoObj have all function, the NorObj just a reference object.
